Hi! I'm Eric Chan, a game programmer from China. I've been making games with the Warcraft III World Editor since I was 12. During my student years, I played numerous games, which inspired me to attend Northeastern University(China). There, I studied Digital Media Technology, a program specifically designed to cultivate professionals for the gaming industry. During my junior year, I completed a one-year internship at Tencent(Massive Entertainment), working as a game developer. After graduating in 2023, I joined the AAA project at Yotta Games, where I have been working as a game developer ever since.

Here you can view some demos that I either created or contributed to. Some of them were created as part of my experiments with gaming technology, others were developed during game jams, and some were projects I worked on during my internships. Anyway, I hope you enjoy exploring this content. (^o^)/
