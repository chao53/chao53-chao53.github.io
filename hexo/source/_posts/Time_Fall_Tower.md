This is a project I worked on while participating in a mini-game competition. Our development team consisted of six members, and I served as the lead programmer. I was responsible for developing the core framework of the game, which included a highly scalable RPG framework and the specific implementation of many character skills. The gameplay combines the combat and shopping system from Brotato with the synergy system of Auto Chess.
